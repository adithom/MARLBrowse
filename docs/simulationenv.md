[Pegasus Simulator](https://github.com/PegasusSimulator/PegasusSimulator) is a framework built on top of NVIDIA Omniverse and IsaacSim. It is designed to provide an easy yet powerful way of simulating the dynamics of vehicles. It provides a simulation interface for PX4 and ArduPilot integration, as well as a custom python control interface.
